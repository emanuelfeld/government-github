Please note, when using GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise, there are four alternate ways to interact with stored content:

1. Via the [GitHub.com](https://github.com) or [GitHub Enterprise](https://enterprise.github.com) web interface through a modern browser
2. Via the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) application
3. Via the GitHub's open [application programming interface](https://developer.github.com/v3/) (API) which provides information in a machine-readable format for integration with other applications
4. Via the open source [Git](http://git-scm.com/) command line (interactive, entirely text-bassed) interface

Where support below is indicated below as "Supports with exceptions", such a qualification applies to the particular product being evaluated, however, interactions may be accomplished through alternate means such as via the Git command-line interface.
